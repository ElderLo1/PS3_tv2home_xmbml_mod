# PS3_tv2home_xmbml_mod
A simple PS3 xmbml mod turning the TV category into a directory for PlayStation Home offline builds. Also removes the Home icon from appearing under the PSN category to better suit this change.

Home builds will appear under a folder within TV/Video Services, allowing you to not only run several builds of Home Offline, but also download them directly from your PS3! (HEN or CFW required! This will NOT work on OFW!)

Has been tested working on HEN 4.89.
