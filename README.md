# PS3_tv2home_xmbml_mod
A simple PS3 xmbml mod turning the TV category into a directory for PlayStation Home offline builds. Also removes the Home icon from appearing under the PSN category to better suit this change.

Home builds will appear under a folder within TV/Video Services, allowing you to not only run several builds of Home Offline, but also download them directly from your PS3! (HEN or CFW required! This will NOT work on OFW!)

Has been tested working on HEN 4.89. I would advise against installing this on a version lower or higher than this firmware.

Please bear in mind that I am a total noob when it comes to XMBML modding. It's working for me personally, but I am not responsible for the chance of you bricking your own console with this.

## To-do:
- Find a way to give each version on the XMB it's own title with the version number rather than all of them simply saying "PlayStation Home". Hope it's possible without RCO editing but very unlikely to be honest.

## Special Thanks to:
- DeViL303 for his excellent work and documentation on XMBML
- PS3DevWiki for being a good learning source for XMBML code
- Sony for the creation of the PS3
